**About this repository**

This repository contains my final project for the Web Services and Applications (WSAA) module, 2025. The main goal is to develop a web application that allows for board game management, implementing concepts of web service architecture and modern applications.

## üß© Project Description

This projects follow the instructions provided in the Github of the lecture [Andrew Beatty](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/WSAA-Courseware/blob/main/labs/WSAA%20Project%20Description.pdf)

The application allows users to:

* **View a list of available board games.**
* **Add new games to the catalog.**
* **Edit and delete existing games.**

The project is developed using **Python** for the backend and **JavaScript** for the frontend, following a **client-server architecture**.

## üìù Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of **creating and consuming RESTful APIs** in a real-world web application. It allows for flexibility, which makes it useful for real-world scenarios, as you can easily adapt it for different use cases.

### Project Features:

1. **REST API** to perform **CRUD operations** on data.
2. **One database table** (MySQL) to store board game data.
3. **Web interface** with **AJAX calls** to interact with the API and perform CRUD operations.

The application was built using **Flask**, with a focus on allowing users to interact with board game data by adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving information.

The app is **hosted on PythonAnywhere** for remote access.

## üöÄ Technologies & Environments Used

* **Flask** ‚Äì Web framework for Python.
* **MySQL** ‚Äì Database to store board game data.
* **JavaScript (AJAX)** ‚Äì For interacting with the API.
* **HTML5 / CSS** ‚Äì Web interface design.
* **Python 3.12** ‚Äì For running the project locally.
* **PythonAnywhere** ‚Äì Hosting platform for deploying the Flask app.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jennyicano/WSAA_Big_project.git
```

Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd WSAA_Big_project
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

For **macOS/Windows**, make sure you're using the correct Python version (e.g., Python 3.12).

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

* **macOS/Linux**:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

* **Windows**:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application Locally to Check the Web Interface (Windows/macOS)

1. **On Windows**:

   * Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and navigate to the project directory.
   * Activate the virtual environment and run the application:

     ```bash
     python app_server.py
     ```
   * Open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to interact with the web app.

2. **On macOS**:

   * Open the terminal, activate the virtual environment, and run:

     ```bash
     python app_server.py
     ```
   * Visit the web app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## üåç Deploying on PythonAnywhere

This project is hosted on **PythonAnywhere** for remote access. Here's how to check and interact with your deployed application.

1. **PythonAnywhere URL**:
   Once deployed, your application will be available through a URL provided by PythonAnywhere (e.g., `yourusername.pythonanywhere.com`). In my project the URL is this one 'https://jennyicano.pythonanywhere.com'

2. **Bash Console** in PythonAnywhere:

   You can access the Bash console to run commands on PythonAnywhere:

   * Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jennyicano/WSAA_Big_project.git
   ```

   * Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd WSAA_Big_project
   ```

   * Set up the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   * Install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **WSGI Configuration**: here we need to ensure that the WSGI file in PythonAnywhere points to the correct entry point of the app (`app_server.py`).

   For help with WSGI-related issues, refer to this PythonAnywhere guide:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Future Enhancements

* Add user authentication for creating and managing board games.
* Expand the database to include additional attributes for board games.
* Improve the user interface with more advanced front-end frameworks like React or Vue.js.
